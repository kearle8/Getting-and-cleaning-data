# Getting-and-cleaning-data course project
Week 4 project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

# Background
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# Project Data

# Project expectations
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Repository
In addition to this ReadMe file, the repository contains a CodeBook with a description of the variables and work performed to clean up the data.  The run_analysis.R file contains all of the scripts used to merge, clean and transform the data into a new tidy data set.  And finally, the new tidy data set is also included as a .txt file.
